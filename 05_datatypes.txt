05_Data Types:
        Data types is defined as the which type of data a value of a variable can hold.
The different types of data are.
1. Numeric Types: int,float,complex 
2. Text Type: str, Sequence Types:list, tuple and Set Types:
3. Mapping Type
4. Boolean Type
5. None Type

String Data types:
        These data types are made of letters these are enclosed inside a single or double quotes.
literal assignment:
        where the values of variable is assigned directly eg:- name = "name"
To check data types:
        We use type function to check the data type of a variable.
1. print(type(first))
        we can also use the type function to check wether the data type of a particular variable is same.
2. print(type(first) == str) which in return true or false.
        we can also use instance function to check the data type of a variable.
3. print(isinstance(first, str)) which in return true or false.
4. Concatination:
        We can concatinate two string with a help of "+" operator i.e: "paul" + "prabahar"
Note we can concat only string not any other datatype otherwise it throws an 
error: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
