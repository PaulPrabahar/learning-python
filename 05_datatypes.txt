05_Data Types:
        Data types is defined as the which type of data a value of a variable can hold.
The different types of data are.
1. Numeric Types: int,float,complex 
2. Text Type: str, Sequence Types:list, tuple and Set Types:
3. Mapping Type
4. Boolean Type
5. None Type

String Data types:
        These data types are made of letters these are enclosed inside a single or double quotes.
literal assignment:
        where the values of variable is assigned directly eg:- name = "name"
To check data types:
        We use type function to check the data type of a variable.
1. print(type(first))
        we can also use the type function to check wether the data type of a particular variable is same.
2. print(type(first) == str) which in return true or false.
        we can also use instance function to check the data type of a variable.
3. print(isinstance(first, str)) which in return true or false.
4. Concatination:
        We can concatinate two string with a help of "+" operator i.e: "paul" + "prabahar"
Note we can concat only string not any other datatype otherwise it throws an 
error: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
5.Multiline string:
        We can create a multi line string with the help of ( ''' ''' ) it can also consider whitespace and print them.
6.Escaping special character:
        we can escape special character with the help of \ .
7.String methods:
        There are many string methods like replace("good", "bad") which make's a replacement in thegiven string.
        title() which makes all the first letter of a string capital. 
        len() to calculate a length of a string.
        strip() to remove whitespace from a string.
        center() to center the string, also to replace empty spot with character.
        ljust() to justify left side and replace remaining spot with character.
        rjust() to justify right side and replace remaining spot with character.
