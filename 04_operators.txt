1. "+" for addition
2. "-" for subraction
3. "*" for multiplication
4. "/" for division but gives decimel value
5. "//" for floor division (if 2.5 it gives 2)
6. round(x/y) for rounding up (if 2.3 it gives 3)
7. "**" for exponent 

Concatination:
"+" is also used for concatination of two string.

Comparision Operator:

4. "!=" compare the first value is not equal to second value.
5. "<" compare the first value is lesser than second value.
6. ">" compare the first value is greater than second value.

Boolean operator:
         These are logical operator which check condition and return boolean values.
 
1. "not" it changes the value to opposite if y=true then it returns to false.
2. "and" it checkes that if both condition true then it returns true else it returns false.
3. "or" it checkes that if any one is condition  true then it return true, if both condition are false then it return false .

Ternary operator:
        This is a short hand version of the if,else statement, To create a ternary operator follw these steps.
1. if output first
2. followed by if condition
3. Then else block
4. followed by else output
eg:- print("hello") if name == 1 else print("goodbye").
