01. INTRODUCTION
In my initial exploration of Python, I first grasped its fundamental workings. 
Python, a high-level programming language, utilizes interpreters to transform human-readable code into machine-executable instructions.
The Python interpreter consists of two main components: a compiler and the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). 
The compiler fetches the file and converts it into bytecode. 
This bytecode is then processed by the PVM, which translates it into machine code before storing it in memory.
It's worth noting that the bytecode generated during this process is stored in a folder automatically created by Python called "pycache."
